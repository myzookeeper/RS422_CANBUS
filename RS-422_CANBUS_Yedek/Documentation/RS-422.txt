Module "AD1"       (component ADC)
   - AD1_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_MeasureChan -This method performs measurement on one channel. (Note: If the <number of conversions> is more than one 
                the conversion of the A/D channel is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_GetChanValue8 -This method returns the last measured value of the required channel. Compared with <GetChanValue> 
                method this method returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD 
                resolution> is less than 8 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - AD1_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.

Module "AS1"       (component AsynchroSerial)
   - AS1_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read.
   - AS1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS1_RecvBlock -If any data is received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental error), 
                otherwise it returns an error code (it does not wait for data).  This method is available only if non-zero 
                length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested number of 
                characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified 
                destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter is set to 
                the number of received characters.
   - AS1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters to the channel.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output 
                buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS1_ClearRxBuf -Clears the receive buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the input buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - AS1_ClearTxBuf -Clears the transmit buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - AS1_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver 
                property is enabled.
   - AS1_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled.

Module "WAIT1"     (component Wait)
   - WAIT1_Wait10Cycles -Wait for 10 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_Wait100Cycles -Wait for 100 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_WaitCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (16bit data type).
   - WAIT1_WaitLongCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (32bit data type).
   - WAIT1_Waitms -Wait for a specified time in milliseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitus -Wait for a specified time in microseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitns -Wait for a specified time in nano seconds.
   - WAIT1_WaitOSms -If an RTOS is enabled, this routine will use a non-blocking wait method. Otherwise it will do a 
                busy/blocking wait.
   - WAIT1_Init -Driver initialization routine.

Module "MCUC1"     (component McuLibConfig)
   - MCUC1_Init -Driver initialization method
   - MCUC1_Deinit -Driver deinitialization method

Module "CAN1"      (component FreescaleCAN)
   - CAN1_SetAcceptanceCode -Sets the acceptance code registers. This method writes a code mask directly to the acceptance code 
                registers.
   - CAN1_SetAcceptanceMask -Sets the acceptance mask registers. This method writes an acceptance mask directly to the 
                acceptance mask registers.
   - CAN1_SetAcceptanceMode -Sets the acceptance mode register.
   - CAN1_SendFrame -Sends the frame via the CAN device. Using this method the user can send own message to the CAN bus. This 
                method allows to specify CAN buffer number, message ID, data to be sent and frame type 
                (DATA_FRAME/REMOTE_FRAME).
   - CAN1_ReadFrame -Reads a frame from the CAN device. The user is informed about CAN reception through OnFullRxBuffer event 
                or GetStateRX method.
   - CAN1_GetStateTX -Returns a value of the transmission complete flags.
   - CAN1_GetStateRX -Returns a value of the reception complete flag.
   - CAN1_GetError -Returns the content of the receiver flag register.
   - CAN1_SendFrameExt -Sends a frame. This method automatically selects a free transmit buffer for data transmission. The user 
                cannot specify a transmit buffer.

Module "Cpu"       (component MC9S12ZVCA192_64)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_SetWaitMode -Set low power mode - Wait mode.   For more information about the wait mode see documentation of this CPU. 
                Release from Wait mode: Reset or interrupt
   - Cpu_SetStopMode -Set low power mode - Stop mode.   For more information about the stop mode see documentation of this CPU.
   - Cpu_Delay100US -This method realizes software delay. The length of delay is at least 100 microsecond multiply input 
                parameter [us100]. As the delay implementation is not based on real clock, the delay time may be increased by 
                interrupt service routines processed during the delay. The method is independent on selected speed mode.
